## 1. FLOATING



This is the first NFT I minted. The animation was created using Adobe Animation Studio, programmed in ActionScript II and was part of an interactive music visual set that was used to perform alongside house DJs in San Fransisco, CA in 2020.



This is the first release of part of the collection. The fully interactive visual set includes various programmable, keyboard controlable attributes such as star speed and direction, earth rotation and spin, orbiting planets and much more.
